# E-Commerce Platform
Overview
This project involves creating an e-commerce platform using a microservices architecture. The platform includes services for user management, product catalog, order processing, payment handling, and notifications. Technologies such as ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, RabbitMQ, Redis, Docker, and Kubernetes will be utilized, along with Eureka for service discovery and an API Gateway for request routing.

## Microservices
- UserService: Manages user registration and authentication.
- ProductService: Handles product catalog, search, and filtering.
- OrderService: Manages shopping cart and order processing.
- PaymentService: Handles payment processing and transaction management.
- NotificationService: Sends real-time notifications for order status changes.
## Features
+ User Registration and Authentication: Securely register and authenticate users.
+ Product Catalog: Display products with search and filtering capabilities.
+ Shopping Cart and Order Management: Allow users to manage their shopping carts and process orders.
+ Payment Processing: Handle secure payments and manage transactions.
+ Real-time Notifications: Notify users about order status changes in real time.

## Architecture and Concepts
- Microservices Architecture: Independent services that communicate over APIs.
- Event-Driven Communication: Using RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging between services.
- Caching: Using Redis for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.
- Data Access: Entity Framework Core for database interactions.
- API Development: Developing RESTful APIs for communication between microservices.
- Security: Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Logging and Monitoring: Using tools for logging and monitoring service health and performance.

## Technologies
- ASP.NET Core: For building the microservices.
- Entity Framework Core: For data access and ORM.
- RabbitMQ: For messaging and event-driven communication.
- Redis: For caching.
- Docker: For containerizing the microservices.
- Kubernetes: For orchestration and management of Docker containers.
- Consul: For service discovery.
- API Gateway: For routing and managing API requests.
